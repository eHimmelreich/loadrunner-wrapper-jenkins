# loadrunner-wrapper-jenkins

HP LoadRunner Wrapper Plugin allows to execute LoadRunner scenario, apply analysis template and to compare transactions response times with predefined threshold.
This plugin does not require usage of SLA or Performance center and works with standalone installation.
Transactions which responce time is above the threshold are marked as failed testcases.
